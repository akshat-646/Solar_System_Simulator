**Solar System Simulator**

This is a 3D interactive Solar System Simulator built with React and Three.js. It allows users to explore a scaled model of our solar system, view planets orbiting the Sun, and click on individual celestial bodies to get more information.

**Features**

**3D Visualization**: Renders a realistic (scaled) 3D model of the solar system.

**Interactive Camera**: Orbit controls allow users to pan, zoom, and rotate around the solar system.

**Planet Orbits**: Planets accurately orbit the Sun based on their relative speeds and distances.

**Axial Tilt & Rotation**: Each celestial body rotates on its axis with its correct axial tilt.

**Moon Orbit**: The Moon orbits the Earth.

**Information Panel**: Click on any planet or the Sun to display a detailed information panel with its name and description.

**Dynamic Loading**: Models are loaded dynamically with a loading progress indicator.

**Responsive Design**: Adapts to different screen sizes.

**3D Models**:The 3D models in the Solar System Simulator interact to create a dynamic and informative experience.

**Technologies Used**

**React**: For building the user interface.

**Three.js**: A JavaScript 3D library for rendering the solar system.

**GLTFLoader (Three.js)**: For loading 3D models (GLTF format) of celestial bodies.

**OrbitControls (Three.js)**: For interactive camera controls.

**CSS**: For basic styling and layout.
